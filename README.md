We are building a project that helps detecting accidents and traffic rules violations and informs the hospital, and police department regarding the accidents as soon as possible other than this, it issues online challan (fine) for breaking the traffic rules (by detecting the number plate of the car)

all this done using the live footage from cameras placed by government near all the traffic lights, we use AI technology to train the model based on thousands of road accidents and violations so that provides highest possible accuracy in detection of these situations. 

So ultimately this project helps reducing time taken to provide relief to the people got affected by the accidents and fast/ reliable way to punish traffic rule breakers using AI, thus reducing the manual workforce and overall chances of delay and errors.
